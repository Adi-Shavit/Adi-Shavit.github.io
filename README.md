# Concepts
This blog is an attempt by me to create a repository filled with simple detailed explanations and code examples of programming topics that interest me.

It's called `Concepts` because I won't be going into massive projects, only their main underlying concepts in such a way that you can later develop them on your own, and use them in bigger projects.

Aside from that I'm also going to be discussing interesting terms and ideas that aren't always talked about in the developing community.
